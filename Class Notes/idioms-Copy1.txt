the pot calling the kettle black
don't put the cart before the horse
hit the nail on the head
the ball is in your court
one in the hand is worth more than two in the bush
biting off more than you can chew
let the cat out of the bag
kick the bucket
cost an arm and a leg
burn the midnight oil
there are many fish in the sea
bite the bullet
the elephant in the room
spill the beans
jump on the bandwagon
cry over spilled milk
when pigs fly
out of the frying pan and into the fire
time flies when you're having fun
bite the hand that feeds you
go the extra mile
you can't judge a book by it's cover
the whole nine yards
cut to the chase
don't count your chickens before they hatch
speak of the devil
look before you leap
it's raining cats and dogs
a taste of your own medicine
cross that bridge when you come to it
every cloud has a silver lining
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink
variety is the space of life
once in a blue moon
to make a long story short
wear your heart on your sleeve
keep the ball rolling
the icing on th cake
walking on eggshells
a needle in a haystack
tip of the iceberg
off the beaten path
a dime a dozen
